# Summary 
We are trying to create a rating system for teachers. We will be taking data that is given by students. Later on, if we are ahead of schedule, we will also try to have the students write comments and we will have a more specific criteria so they can grade their teaching, how hard the tests are, and their knowledge on the material and so on. We will use CRUD to monitor the reviews that are given for offensive and/or hateful messages, and we will try to create a system that prevents students from commenting repeatedly to inflate or deflate any teacherâ€™s rating. Our major goal is to have a concrete understanding on data as well as to provide teachers some constructive feedback so that they can improve their teaching. Many teachers are not that adept at teaching online, and can use this as a learning experience to improve their teaching style.

# Log 
* 1/15/21: We were able to add our diliverables that was able to corrospond to our scrum board. [Scrum Board](https://github.com/LordRoop/P4-Ducks/projects/1) One main ticket ideas were to have a much more ellegant UI, which is deliverbale three. Another main ticket idea was to have an evaluation page where people can rate the teachers, dilverable two. Finally, the last diliverable was to make sure make a login page, where it promotes the user to put username and password and we also created a sign up page as well to avoid spam ratings! Big ticket ideas planned: Comments, Liking comments, Star Reviews, Search bar feature
@ Aiden is working on the back end code. A near futrue goal is to be able to manage data in a database. It can be used to manage accounts, likes, rating and comments. 

* 1/8/21: We were able to create different pages for different departments. We then created a spreadsheet with all the teacher's names and put them in on the website. We used a card format so on each teacher card, it would display an icon related to their subject, their name and stars for rating them. Eventually, we will make them buttons that will lead to teacher's own pages for ratings and comments. We also added a background and added a dictionary. This will help us to have icons that will lead to different links like out github.   

* 12/11/20: GitHub repository set up. Updated Readme. Scrumboard Created. [Project plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wxPf8kZwcLD7A78uW7GT-fFjmGbNxHtRAVDDZ21xz30/edit?usp=sharing) made
